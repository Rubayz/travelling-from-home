<h1>Travelling from home</h1> 
<p>You can travel the whole world with only 5 lines of python code!! It is not that you are really going,.. it will paste your image to a nice image of your favourite place. Thats it!</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/">Pillow</a> Package for this </p>
Example:-
